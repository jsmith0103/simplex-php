# Simplex PHP

Fast, simple, user-friendly, and easy-to-use framework for PHP.

### Getting started
This documentation is to help you get to know the framework well. From folder structures to individual files, this will help you get through.

### Pre-note
This framework runs best on PHP7. However, older versions starting from PHP5+ are still supported. But for best results and to be updated with future updates, it is best to run on PHP7.

### Installing and testing
1. Download the files
2. Copy the files into your root folder (For example www.localhost.com:8080)
3. You should see the "Welcome Page" upon running. If you don't, then proceed to Q & A section of this file.

### Build with
* [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel) - Included in the root library (still updating to PhpSpreadsheet)
* [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) - Included in the root library
